# Digital-Signal-Processing

## The Assignment:
The fundamental goal of this research is to improve one's understanding of digital signal processing (DSP) concepts and procedures. 
Sequence generation, convolution, correlation, difference equations, and the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) are all discussed. 
It aims to develop MATLAB skills in manipulating sequences, conducting convolution operations, computing and comprehending cross-correlations, 
solving difference equations, and doing frequency analysis.

## System identification Techniques RLS and LMS algorithms in python
the project aims to provide hands-on experience in system identification and adaptive filtering, helping to 
understand how these techniques can be used to estimate filter coefficients and model unknown systems in practical applications.
